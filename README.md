# Paw

## Project description

Paw is a web application similar to Tinder, but Paw focuses on pet adoption. There are two types of users; keepers and animal shelters. Keepers are users who want to adopt or help with caring for pets that they liked. They can filter pets by species, location, distance, and age. Keepers as well have access to a list of all liked animals, and their acceptance status. On the other hand, users who are representing animal shelters can add new pets to share with keepers. To add a new pet, they have to provide its image, name, breed, age, and optional description. Animal shelters have also a list of their animals with a list of all interested keepers, and they can accept or discard keepers who liked a specified pet.
